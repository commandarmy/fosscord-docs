# Guild Features

Guild features are special modifiers assigned to guilds for additional functionality.

In {{ project.name }}, guild features are stored in the `features` column of the `guilds` table as a comma separated list, with no spaces.
For example, `ANIMATED_ICON,BANNER,DISCOVERABLE`.

A list of all guild features implemented on Discord.com is available [here](https://github.com/Delitefully/DiscordLists#guild-feature-glossary)
